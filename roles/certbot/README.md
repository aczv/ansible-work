## Certbot command examples

Obtain certificates by placing files in a webroot directory.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly \
    --webroot --staging --agree-tos --no-eff-email \
    -m admin@example.com \
    -w /usr/share/nginx/html -d monki.biz -d www.monki.biz
```

Once a certificate is revoked (or for other certificate management tasks), all of a certificateâ€™s relevant files can be removed from the system with the delete subcommand:

```bash
certbot delete --cert-name monki.biz
```
